When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When ia want to colaborate with other people or show the world what I am doing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don't want to have unfiniched commits always available.
